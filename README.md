# APLenty
Active Proactive Learning System

We present APLenty, an annotation tool for creating high-quality sequence labeling datasets using active and proactive learning.
A major innovation of our tool is the integration of automatic annotation with active learning and proactive learning.
This makes the task of creating labeled datasets easier, less time-consuming and requiring less human effort.
APLenty is highly flexible and can be adapted to various other tasks.
